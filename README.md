[Turing School](https://turing.edu/) is an industry leading, online computer programming school, focused solely on helping students launch fulfilling careers in technology.

In week 1 of Mod 2 the first solo project assignment is a multiday solo project named Relational Rails. Listed below are our specifications and outcomes of the project. 

## Learning Goals

* Design a one-to-many relationship using a schema designer.
* Write migrations to create tables with columns of varying data types and foreign keys.
* Use Rails to create web pages that allow users to CRUD resources.
* Create instance and class methods on a Rails model that use ActiveRecord methods and helpers.
* Write model and feature tests that fully cover data logic and user behavior.

## Built With

Ruby v2.7.4 and Rails 5.2.8, RSpec 3.12 versions, PostgreSQL.

## Testing

A key goal of this project is to utilize Test Driven Development for models and features, and the SimpleCov gem to determine percentage of test coverage.

## About

This was my first independant Rails project using a one-to-many relationship of salons and workstations. This project was modeled after a business model that I created for independant hairstylist to be able to access salon space on demand. Although, today this project isn't completed to a point that meets all my planned learning objectives, I was able to achieve each of the project's learning goals. In the future I plan to expand upon this rough draft to refine the application and create more robust testing for continued learning. For more information on the business model that I will continue to develop this application for visit [The COSALON](https://thecosalon.com).
